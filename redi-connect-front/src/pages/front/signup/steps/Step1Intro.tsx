          <p>Hi!</p>
          <p>
            Welcome to the ReDI School of Digital Integration and thank you for
            registering as a mentor at ReDI Connect. At ReDI we believe that
            integration starts with the simple word „Hello“. So: Hello! With the
            mentorship program we want to connect our students with you as
            mentors because we think finding an answer to a question is easier
            with a counterpart than alone. Our students can benefit from your
            experience, your network, your knowledge and you are able to share
            your knowledge with new talents, maybe get new ideas, look at things
            from a different perspective or simply meet a great person!
          </p>
          <p>
            You can now fill out your profile, we will guide you through the
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have filled out your profile you will receive
            application(s) from (a) potential mentee(s). Once you have accepted
            an application you are ready to start your sessions with your
            mentee.
          </p>
          <p>
